					<h2>How they work</h2>
					<p>If you are really motivated to improve your French quickly, Lingua Franca’s private lessons may be the right choice for you.</p>
					<p>We hold our private lessons at our offices in Newstead. However, if you'd rather we come to your home or office or even a favourite café or bookstore, contact us and we can try to arrange this. We also offer live one-on-one lessons via Skype<sup>TM</sup> if you do not live in Brisbane or if that option simply suits you better.</p>
					<p>We are able to tailor lessons according to your requirements and part of our first lesson is devoted to establishing exactly what is it you are looking to achieve. Perhaps you did French at school 150 years ago (as one of our clients put it!) and have lost your confidence, or perhaps you just need a few lessons before a planned trip to a French-speaking country. Perhaps you’re about to take a job overseas or perhaps you have a reason all your own.</p>
					<p>In fact, there are countless reasons why people choose to learn French. Why don’t you <a href="#contactBanner">contact us</a> to see if we can arrange some lessons to suit your needs?</p>

					<h2>How they work</h2>
					<p>Our group lessons take place in Newstead, Paddington and Bulimba.</p>
					<p>Our Newstead classes are held at our <em>petit nid </em>(little nest) at 22 Masters St. Bulimba classes are at the lovely SideStreet Vintage store on Oxford St and our Paddington home is at Francesca's Flowers on Latrobe Terrace.</p>
					<p>No matter where you go for your lesson, we aim to create a warm and convivial atmosphere so you are able to learn in an relaxed and enjoyable way. Keeping the classes to a maximum of eight students helps, too.</p>
					<p><strong>Four different types</strong> of courses are offered, so finding something to suit your needs is easy.</p>

					<p>These are our foundation courses and are designed to teach you the fundamentals of French. Courses run for six weeeks (an hour a week) and cost $250 (inc. GST). We have four main levels: absolute beginner, beginner, intermediate and advanced, with four different courses in each level available. (1,2,3 and revision).</p>
					<p>Course fee includes tuition and our purpose-written workbooks which we have developed for our students. Pronunciation support in the form of short videos is included on our website so you are able to practise at home.</p>
					<h3>Speaking Practice - 4 weeks 1hr/wk</h3>
					<p>These courses are focused on getting you speaking. We offer classes for all levels of competency. This means that for every Key Course, there is a Speaking Practice Course that will give you the opportunity to put into use what you have just learned. The course are of four weeks' duration and an hour a week and can be combined with a Key Course to give you ten weeks of French. Cost is $170 (inc. GST), or combined with a Key Course the total is $399 (inc.GST). The cost includes tuition as well as innovative in-class support materials designed to increase your confidence.</p>
					<p>*We also have an Advanced Conversation that runs throughout the year. <a href="#contactBanner">Contact us</a> for more information.</p>
					<h3>Workshops - 2 weeks 2hrs/wk</h3>
					<p>These two-week courses focus on a particular topic, such as travel, pronunciation, fashion, food, numbers or culture and give you the chance to hone your skills specifically in these areas. Classes run for two hours a week (a total of four hours) and cost $170 (inc. GST). Cost includes instruction and a purpose-written booklet which is yours to keep.</p>
					<h3>Consolidation - 10 weeks 1hr/wk</h3>
					<p>Whether you feel you’d like to ‘put the brakes on’ your learning for a little while or whether you’d like to reinforce what you’ve learned while continuing on with your Key Courses, our new Monday night Consolidation Courses could be just what you’re looking for.These courses run throughout the year in ten-week blocks and cost $399. The first time you sign up, you’ll receive a workbook which is yours to keep. This workbook is designed to encourage you to speak.</p>

					<h2>Right for me?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Do you like a challenge?</li>
						<li>Do you feel your French has come to a bit of a standstill?</li>
						<li>Do you particularly want to improve your spoken French?</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Then joining a DELF training program may be just the ticket for you.</p>
					<!--DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS--><p>For more detailed information on the DELF, please refer to <a href="#FAQbutton" id="FAQbutton">our FAQs page.</a></p>
					<h2>What is the DELF?</h2>
					<p>DELF stands for <em>Diplôme d’Études en Langue Française</em> and by training for and passing an exam, you will receive an internationally recognised certificate proving your level of French proficiency. This looks great on a CV, can help you get into a French university and is an achievement in and of itself.</p>
					<h2>What's my level?</h2>
					<p><strong>A1:</strong> elementary level (approx. 1 year of French)</p>
					<p><strong>A2:</strong> elementary level (approx. 2 years of French)</p>
					<p><strong>B1:</strong> independent level (approx. 3 years of French)</p>
					<p><strong>B2:</strong> independent level (approx. 4 years of French)</p>
					<h2>Our track record</h2>
					<p>Our brave students have achieved have an average score of 90.72% between them.</p>
					<p>While delighted with their results of course, all agree that the major benefit in preparing for and sitting the exam was the <strong>extreme improvement they saw in their French, particularly their confidence when speaking. </strong></p>
					<h2>Proposed Schedule</h2>
					<!--REFORMAT THIS AS HTML <p>PIC GOES HERE<span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/DELF%202015%20%20Proposed%20schedule.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1421204238844" alt=""></p>-->
					<h2>More info?</h2>
					<p>Signing up for the DELF is certainly a commitment, but probably less than you think.</p>
					<p>You'll possibly still have some questions, though, so if you're unsure of your level or if you'd like to know class times and days, please <a href="#contactBanner">contact us here</a> or call Katrina on 0405 381 972.</p>

				<h1>Unsure? Try an  &#232;chantillon!</h1>

				<p>We often hear from people who have been meaning to start or return to learning French and for one reason or another it hasn't happened. We decided, therefore, to give people the chance to come and try out one of our friendly and relaxed group lessons <em>free of charge</em>. Échantillon is the French word for 'sample' or 'test' and that's exactly what we'd like you to do.</p>

				<p>Often with a love of the French language comes a love of French culture and an interest in the way the French-speaking world does things differently to us.</p> 

				<p>Our seasonal events are designed to bring together like-minded people in a social situation while enjoying the best food, wine, film, fashion (and much more) the French have to offer.</p>

				<p>For all levels and interests - there’s be something for everybody...even a trip to Nouméa in April 2015, too. There will also be a three-day trip to a secret destination for a French Festival in October 2015. Let us know if you'd like to be kept in the loop.</p>
