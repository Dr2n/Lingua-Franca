					<h2>How they work</h2>
					<p>If you are really motivated to improve your French quickly, Lingua Franca’s private lessons may be the right choice for you.</p>
					<p>We hold our private lessons at our offices in Newstead. However, if you'd rather we come to your home or office or even a favourite café or bookstore, contact us and we can try to arrange this. We also offer live one-on-one lessons via Skype<sup>TM</sup> if you do not live in Brisbane or if that option simply suits you better.</p>
					<p>We are able to tailor lessons according to your requirements and part of our first lesson is devoted to establishing exactly what is it you are looking to achieve. Perhaps you did French at school 150 years ago (as one of our clients put it!) and have lost your confidence, or perhaps you just need a few lessons before a planned trip to a French-speaking country. Perhaps you’re about to take a job overseas or perhaps you have a reason all your own.</p>
					<p>In fact, there are countless reasons why people choose to learn French. Why don’t you <a href="#contactBanner">contact us</a> to see if we can arrange some lessons to suit your needs?</p>

Classes run for two hours a week (a total of four hours) and cost $170 (inc. GST). Cost includes instruction and a purpose-written booklet which is yours to keep.</p>
					<h3>Consolidation - 10 weeks 1hr/wk</h3>

						<li>Do you feel your French has come to a bit of a standstill?</li>
						<li>Do you particularly want to improve your spoken French?</li>

					<p>Then joining a DELF training program may be just the ticket for you.</p>
					<p>For more detailed information on the DELF, please refer to our <a href="#FAQbutton" id="FAQbutton">FAQs page.</a></p>
					<h2>What is the DELF?</h2>
					<p>DELF stands for <em>Diplôme d’Études en Langue Française</em> and by training for and passing an exam, you will receive an internationally recognised certificate proving your level of French proficiency. This looks great on a CV, can help you get into a French university and is an achievement in and of itself.</p>
					<h2>What's my level?</h2>
					<p><strong>A1:</strong> elementary level (approx. 1 year of French)</p>
					<p><strong>A2:</strong> elementary level (approx. 2 years of French)</p>
					<p><strong>B1:</strong> independent level (approx. 3 years of French)</p>
					<p><strong>B2:</strong> independent level (approx. 4 years of French)</p>
					<h2>Our track record</h2>
					<p>Our brave students have achieved have an average score of 90.72% between them.</p>
					<p>While delighted with their results of course, all agree that the major benefit in preparing for and sitting the exam was the <strong>extreme improvement they saw in their French, particularly their confidence when speaking. </strong></p>

					<h2>Fees</h2>
					<p>We run DELF preparation classes throughout the year, with two intakes: early February and mid-June.</p>
					<p>Both intakes prepare students for the November exams. If you enrol in February, you'll have 30 weeks to prepare for the exam. A July enrolment will give you 15 weeks, so you can choose what sort of lead-up you'd like to have to the exam and can work it around your other commitments.</p>
